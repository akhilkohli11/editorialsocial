<p>Gandhari is like the best! She&#8217;s married to an asshole blind husband, and she gives up her eye sight to UNDERSTAND WHAT HER HUSBAND IS GOING THROUGH and she is the nicest person in Hastinapur&#8230; like someone give this girl a noble prize! SO MANY FEELS FOR GANDHARI!</p>
<p>also can we just talk about the widow trio of Hastinapur! Like whenever they come on screen I burst out laughing because I imagine them doing Beyonce&#8217;s Single Ladies and SO WRONG but SO RIGHT! </p>
<p>damn all these girls have their hair on point though! </p>
<p>THIS SHOW!</p>
<p>also Pandu is my fav! Pandu feels! He sounds like a man child</p>
<p>AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS TO SLAP KRISHNA WHENEVER HE SAYS SWAYUM VICHAR KARYE (was that even right!?) also he&#8217;s really tall and has the face of a man child and I have Krishna feels as well! </p>
<p>I am so in love with Karna&#8230; out of everyone in the series&#8230; he&#8217;s not only the best looking be can also act!&#8230; ugh he is sooooo cute!</p>
<p>watching mahabharat gets me so emotional i cant even</p>
<p>Writing AU&#8217;s about Hindu mythology? Priceless.</p>
<ul><li>Can we just commend the actress who plays Gandhari for that freaking amazing “KAARAN BANO!” birthing scene because DAMN. Must google her. Also I love Gandhari, she’s probably my fave. </li>
<li>not looking forward to her sons being evil </li>
<li>SHAKUNI. His look is so perfect but I want to slap his face ugh the way he manipulates Dhrishtarashta NO STOP THAT. but I have a weakness for evil characters being emotional SO WHEN HE STARTED TEARING FOR GANDHARI AKLSfhk i just omg :’)</li>
<li>the scenery and locations and sets in this show *___* wow they did a really good job with this.</li>
<li>BHISMA IS FREAKING HOT THAT IS ALL</li>
</ul>
<p><em>BHISMA WAS IN DHOOM HOLY SHIT</em></p>
<p>from riding motorbikes to riding chariots&#8230;still lookin&#8217; damn fine. </p>
<p>Satyavati is so beautiful. She has this aura of elegance and and justice but there’s a slight pain in her eyes and ahhh getting an insight into her history and Bhishma’s oath and now Ganga’s here and wow this is so interesting omg</p>
edit: ok nvm Ganga’s being a kameeni
edit again: nvm Satyavati deserved it
<p>I LOVE YUDHISHTIR SO FREAKING MUCH ALSJDHAH</p>
<p>THE TRAINING GROUND LOOKS FREAKING EXACTLY LIKE CAMP HALF-BLOOD </p>

<p>AND OH MY GOD EKLAVYA IS HERE</p>

<p>THIS SHOW</p>
<p><em>"Apne ho ya paraaye, mitra ho ya shastru…dharm ke iss yudh mein, adharmiyon ka wadh karega yeh Arjun!" -</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_sarHd4VIE">this promo gives me goosebumps</a></p>
<p>i cannot freaking deal with this<br/>
it&#8217;s ripping my heart apart<br/>
i understand that Duryodhan stood up for Karna, the only one who did and that probably means the world to him and he&#8217;ll forever be loyal to him and I did ship their friendship during the 10 seconds of that hug and damn Karna&#8217;s body but like HE&#8217;S EVIL. AND KARNA ARJUN. YOU GUYS ARE BRO&#8217;S UGH i cant watch this</p>

<p>And Kunti knows :&#8217;) IT&#8217;S HER SON. THAT&#8217;S HER BABY. Ugh. Whoever made the movie Karna Arjun sucks because I totally thought they were going to be epic warrior bro bff&#8217;s but it defs doesn&#8217;t look like it right now and it pains me on the insides.</p>
<p>this sucks shit balls. i read the spoilers. fraternicide. ARE YOU KIDDING ME THIS WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY</p>
<p>EFFING PRIYAMVADA DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND SHE SAID MAUN RAHO SO WHY DONT YOU SHUT UP THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT IF SHE HADNT MADE HER MAKE THAT STUPID PROMISE EFF YOU</p>

<p>"N<a href="http://mahabharat-katha.tumblr.com/tagged/nakul">akul</a><span>: Fourth Pandava brother, twin of Sahdev, son of Madri and Ashwini Kumars (Healer gods). <em>Was said to be the most handsome man alive</em>.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/0af9c65076ec85a85855196b40a90650/tumblr_inline_mx2cp4neFV1qb8k7a.jpg"/></span></p>

<p>DRAUPADI YOU CUTIE PIE FLAWLESS AGNI PARI YOU ALAJSHS</p>

<p>No seriously. She is perfect. And the episode was all so beautifully shot, the colours, the clothes, the bath, the music, everything :&#8217;)</p>

<p>AND DRAUPADI ARJUN SHIP FEELS ALL OVER THE PLACE NEAR THE END ALASKSJDJ (Subardra you better not ruin my OTP i dun lyke u bye -.-)</p>
<p>THE WAY ARJUN LOOKED AT HER AS SHE WALKED BY THOUGH AKSLJHFAKSJFH -dies-</p>
<p>GUUURRRRL JUST POINTED THE FINGER BACK AT FREAKING PITAMAHA</p>

<p>YOU GO GURL</p>
<p>You know that thing Arjun/Shaheer does with his voice? When it goes all low and sexy…yeah that thing</p>
<p>How are they ever going to get out of this one? How is Shakuni going to convince him to put himself and draupadi up? WHY CAN&#8217;T HE JUST LEAVE NOW WHY IS THERE MORE MAKE IT STOP</p>
<p>SO I WAS WATCHING SAVDHAAN INDIA YESTERDAY<br/>
AND THE EVIL GUY<br/>
was Balram<br/>
AND HE WAS SO HOT BYE PEDOING OVER BALRAM AND HIS DIMPLE</p>
<p>So I just watched today&#8217;s epi. IDK MAN I ALWAYS THOUGHT KRISHNA KILLED KANS WHEN HE WAS IN HIS BABY FORM AND THE WHOLE TIME I WAS LIKE OMG so excited to see how baby iz gunna kill da fat man BUT THEN THEY EXCHANGED THE BABIES AND BABY GIRL AND THEN THE GODDESS APPEARED AND I WAS EXCITED AGAIN CAUSE FEMALE GODDESS AND OMG IT&#8217;S SUBHADRA&#8217;S FACE!!! Then I thought OH so Subhadra is gunna be that baby girl!! but then I went on wiki and what</p>
<p>&#8220;<span>Subhadra is the daughter of </span><a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudev" title="Vasudev">Vasudev</a><span> and his first wife </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohini_Devi" title="Rohini Devi">Rohini Devi</a><span>. She is much younger to </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna" title="Krishna">Krishna</a><span> and </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balarama" title="Balarama">Balarama</a><span> since she was born after Vasudeva was released from </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamsa" title="Kamsa">Kamsa</a><span>'s prison.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>What</span></p>
<p><span>Oh and the wiki page also says &#8220;<span>Arjuna abducts her&#8221;, was that a deviation by Starbharat then cause they showed it was Subhadra who abducted Arjun? Because it was an awesome deviation then. </span></span></p>
<p>OUR MAHABHARAT BABIES ARE ALL AT STAR PARIVAAR OMG THIS IS SO EXCITING :’D<img alt="Embedded image permalink" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bqvz3UECYAASqz7.jpg"/></p>
<p>in any scenario really, where subhadra is really smart and a good student (i stumbled upon someone&#8217;s chem student headcanon and that really got me. I&#8217;ll link them if i find that post again) and arjun is  badass at archery and is a lot like james potter (smart, witty, slightly arrogant..you know what i mean) and he falls head over heels for subhadra but she isnt really interested and has no time for romance but arjun is just so hopelessly in love that he just NEEDS to make her understand how he feels and needs HER and is adamant on convincing her.<br/>
sigh<br/>
I just really have a lot of subhadra x arjun feels ok</p>

<blockquote>YES YES YES ILY LOLA!!!</blockquote>
<p>ILY MORE &lt;333 Glad you liked it sweets, I was gonna do it as 2 tracks with the sweet, slow recitation in one and the badass band baaja with less audible lyrics in the other&#8230; but then I put them together and I&#8217;m like THIS IS PERFECT and proceeded to replay it 10000000 times. I hope we hear a lot more of it, that blend of gentle and fierce is just right for the character. </p>

<p>look someone write some post-today&#8217;s episode karna/duryodhan fic</p>
<p>like maybe karna wakes, and duryodhan is the one cleaning his wounds, and changing his dressings</p>
<p>and his eyes are slightly red from crying</p>
<p>and karna opens his mouth to explain, but duryodhan lays a warm hand on his shoulder and just tells him to get some rest</p>
<p>and maybe once karna&#8217;s asleep again, duryodhan runs a hand through his hair, crying inside from all the pain his friend has gone through</p>
<p>maybe a kiss is pressed to karna&#8217;s forehead idk i just need fic <em><strong>so bad</strong></em></p>
<p>Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Guys! Star Plus is doing a new Mahabharat, which I found out thanks to my lovely anon, and the promo is so pretty! They just show the back profile of Krishna playing the flute, and the feather in his crown flies away in the wind, and OMG, it&#8217;s just so pretty! The flute music is beautiful!</p>
<p>Sakhi and Sakha</p>
