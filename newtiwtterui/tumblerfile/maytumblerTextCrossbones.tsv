<p>So, Crossbones. Anyone watching? I&#8217;d watch <span> John Malkovich  read the phone book.</span></p>
<p>Crossbones</p>
<p>Crossbones is awesome</p>
<p>if you like pirates and people betraying each other and john malkovich then you should watch Crossbones </p>
<p>(admittedly I personally am there mostly for richard coyle and the rest for john malkovich, because&#8230;. richard coyle, man.)</p>
<p>(thomas lowe is: a doctor, an assassin, not married (and never was), apparently working for the governor of jamaica, a person who speaks french, a person who knows at least a little of cryptography, a sneaky bastard, and as of right now, <em>fascinating. </em><strike>and okay yeah maybe i have a bit of a crush shut up.</strike>)</p>
<p>(I am also very much a fan of john malkovich&#8217;s take on edward teach)</p>
<p>jeff from coupling is in Crossbones.</p>
<p>there&#8217;s probably a Pirates of the Caribbean joke in here somewhere.</p>
<p>twenty minutes into crossbones and i can see why malkovich took the job</p>

<p>but there are already three women on the show who are a hundred times more interesting than the crown&#8217;s jack bauer</p>

<p>if he dies at the end of the pilot i&#8217;ll keep watching</p>

<p>if he&#8217;s the main character and he gets a redemption arc i&#8217;m out</p>
<p>jesus fucking christ is the crown&#8217;s jack bauer going to steal this girl&#8217;s heart from the tragic wheelchair dude</p>
