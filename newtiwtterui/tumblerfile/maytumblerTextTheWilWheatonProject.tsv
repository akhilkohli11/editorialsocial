<p>The show my sister and I got interviewed for at a con last year comes out on May 27th! Watch the Wil Wheaton Project and look out for the Poison Ivy and the female Tardis!</p>
<p><strike>omg i am so sorry about all the personal posts but</strike></p>
<p>HEROES OF COSPLAY, AND THE WIL WHEATON PROJECT ARE PREMIERING TONIGHT! </p>
<p>I JUST FREAKING LOVE WIL WHEATON, SO I&#8217;M EXCITED.</p>
<p>AND I KNOW I COMPLAINED A LOT ABOUT THE FIRST HALF OF HOC, BUT I AM REALLY HOPING THEY DO A BETTER JOB THIS TIME. SHOW MORE OF THE CREATING PROCESS, STOP MAKING IT SEEM THAT PEOPLE ONLY DO COSPLAY FOR COMPETITIONS BECAUSE WHILE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT, NOT EVERYONE DOES IT FOR THAT.</p>
<p>AND DESPITE THE ISSUES WITH THE FIRST EPISODES, I REALLY DO LIKE IT. I LOVE SEEING THE HARD WORK AND DEDICATION THESE PEOPLE PUT FORTH. I LOVE SEEING THE FINISHED RESULTS. IT INSPIRES ME TO DO SOMETHING. I MEAN, I HAVEN&#8217;T DONE ANYTHING YET, BUT SOMEDAY I WILL. BECAUSE THEY ARE AMAZING AND TALENTED, LIKE WOAH. AND I WANT TO BE AT THAT LEVEL EVENTUALLY. </p>
<p>Cool. Just saw an ad for The Wil Wheaton Project of SyFy (why-o-why SciFi??) Gonna have to remember to DVR ;)</p>

<p>Congrats Wil!</p>

<p>Also, tumblr app, why are you making me go to my blog to post? Just let me do it from my dash! Thank you.</p>
<p>OK, porn music and some clever edits for the Ragnar/Ecbert bath scene? Genius, <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/m5LzhtAysuizjltkOzjzq0g" target="_blank">wilwheaton</a>.</p>
<p>(We were all thinking it anyway. <em>Ecbert</em> was thinking it, ffs. Some madrigal version of that soundtrack was probably his earworm the whole time.)</p>
<p>Watching Wil Wheatons show, kind of expected more than Wil talking in front of a green screen and being almost off screen</p>
