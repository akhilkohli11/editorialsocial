<p>I would like to say in the final scene of the newest episode of Game of Thrones there was a Les Miserables reference (Look Down!) as well as Dark Knight reference (Let her go). All I thought was &#8220;Poor choice of words&#8221; like I was the Joker.</p>

<p>What kills me everytime about someone I&#8217;m attracted to is <em>their voice.</em></p>
<p><em>Peter DInklage.</em></p>
<p>is fucking handsome</p>
<p>and god he&#8217;s fucking voice</p>
<p>does <em>things</em> to me</p>
<p>all i&#8217;ve been doing in my free time for the past 2 weeks is watch game of thrones and now i&#8217;m caught up and i literally don&#8217;t know what to do with myself</p>
