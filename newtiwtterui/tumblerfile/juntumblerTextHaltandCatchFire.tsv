<p>I don’t work for IBM……. Let’s have sex…. But I don’t love you….. Fuck. Oh and it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll get the job. Halt and Catch Fire is gonna be an awesome series!!!!!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love this show. I&#8217;m even translator for my language, because I want more people to watch it but I think because of last episode that people got wrong Joe MacMillan character. I&#8217;d lie, if I&#8217;d say I didn&#8217;t like the making out scene but I have to disappoint maybe many of you: it doesn&#8217;t mean Joe is bisexual. Why? More under cut.<!-- more -->I think like many other people that Joe is sociopath. I&#8217;m not psychiatrist, nor psychologist but I&#8217;m interested in social psychology and after 3 episodes I can say that he&#8217;s probably sociopath. Why? Some examples:</p>
<ul><li>in the first episode Gordon asks Joe if he has family. He said nothing. It was looking like Joe doesn&#8217;t understand that maybe the family is more important for Gordon.</li>
<li>he seduced Cameron and it seemed like he didn&#8217;t get it, why she was angry, when she realized that he is not in love with her.</li>
<li>in the second episode Cameron wanted to have sex with him but he didn&#8217;t want, he was angry. Because in that case sex wouldn&#8217;t be useful for him. So, sex is just a tool for him, to get what he wants.</li>
<li>not about sex but he still doesn&#8217;t understand people&#8217;s feelings. Like when Gordon was really worried about people getting fired because of Joe&#8217;s ideas, and he still was talking about his new vision.</li>
<li>it seems like he always wants to win, no matter what. He just gets what he wants. </li>
<li>he just uses people to get his goals. Feelings mean nothing to him. No empathy. Not to mention he can act passive agressive and tell touching story just to get what he desires.</li>
<li>he constantly lies. We don&#8217;t know anything reliable about him.</li>
<li>he secuded a man probably not because he is bisexual but just to show that he must always win, no matter what. Travis is mentioned to be in one episode, so I won&#8217;t be surprised that in the next episode he will say that it was disgusting, he&#8217;s not into men, just he did it for money/to reach his goal.</li>
</ul><p>And that&#8217;s all. So don&#8217;t be disappointed if Joe will appear not as bisexual. Because he is sociopath, and sex and sexuality in this case is just a tool - if he can see some benefits in sex with certain person - then he does it. Nothing else.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t like this character. No, moreover, I love him more and more. Even if I can see he is heartless asshole.</p>
<p>SO BASED OFF MY DASH RN I TAKE IT JOE GOT IT ON WITH A DUDE IN HALT AND CATCH FIRE.</p>
<p>I saw someone reading about Halt and Catch Fire.</p>
