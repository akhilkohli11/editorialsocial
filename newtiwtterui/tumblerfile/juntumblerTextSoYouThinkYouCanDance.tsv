<p>Watching &#8220;So You Think You Can Dance&#8221; and J-4 was so adorable and such a great dancer</p>
<p>I hate watching Justin Bieber on So You Think You Can Dance. Ugh.</p>
<p>Just caught up on sytycd today and I forgot how adorable Cyrus is.</p>
<p>I love watching people dance. It is so incredible. People are so talented.Â </p>
<p>Alright. I&#8217;m watching sytycd and misty copeland is a guest judge and I&#8217;m just saying that y&#8217;all would probably love all of the reaction shots of her watching dancers</p>
