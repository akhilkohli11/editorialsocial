<p>I really want to hear Rammstein do a cover of Benni Benassi&#8217;s cover of &#8220;Satisfaction&#8221;, in the style of &#8220;Du Hast&#8221;.</p>

<p>[<strong>Edit</strong>:  Wait, I mean Benassi&#8217;s version?  That wasn&#8217;t a cover of someone else, right?  I haven&#8217;t had my afternoon caffeine yet.]</p>
<p>Am i the only one who finds the sound of thunder really comforting?</p>

<p>I took a picture of myself this morning with my webcam and HOT DAMN I LOOK LIKE A SUAVE GUY!!! O____O <img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/f93d62bea380492872c0494c493e62c9/tumblr_inline_n5uaw5JR2m1qfikno.png"/></p>

<p>I mean I&#8217;m not a guy but DUDE I LOOK LIKE A GUY TO ME, I LOOK LIKE A SUAVE AND SOPHISTICATED MOFO WHO COULD CHARM THE CLOTHING OFF OF ANY PERSON OF MY CHOOSING!!</p>
<p>except for the fact that I&#8217;m socially awkward and couldn&#8217;t charm you if I tried&#8230;as well as the fact that this is a Rei Ryugazaki cosplay and we all know he&#8217;s the dorkiest thing to ever breathe air on this planet.</p>
<p>I enjoy this way too much to the point that I believe I&#8217;m going to step foot into full blown crossplay territory.</p>
