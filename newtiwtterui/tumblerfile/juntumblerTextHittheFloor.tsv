<p>I can&#8217;t be the only one that thought that funeral was triflin</p>
<p>oscar looking like a foot, chase getting arrested, jelena being more stank laughing during her sermon, then being ain&#8217;t shit by fuckin&#8217; that bible thumpin&#8217; white boy in a confessional, pete&#8217;s ain&#8217;t shit wife and oscar&#8217;s try hard son being messy, and kyle&#8230; just being kyle tbh</p>
<p>like there was no mourning like the police was basically breaking up the devil girls equivalent of a triflin dinner party</p>
<p>the only reason i&#8217;m stanning for jelena and zero is because they are both completely ain&#8217;t shit and it&#8217;s that strange kind of admiration of that that keeps me stanning kimye</p>
<p>wait and i&#8217;d like to point out that the only reason ahsha started coming for jelena was because jelena stated coming for ahsha first like it&#8217;s not like ahsha came up in the devils studio on some &#8216;oh gon kick jelena off her spot gonna run this shit&#8217; she came in there really just wanting to dance jelena the one that took it farther than it had to be</p>
<p>Jelena killed Olivia?!!!!! I don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll believe til i see some real evidence because jelena may be cold and messy but i don&#8217;t see her as a killer</p>
<p>honestly i don&#8217;t really care about pete/raquel/pete&#8217;s-ex-who&#8217;s-name-i-can&#8217;t-remember, i wanna know who killed olivia (oh please like jelena can kill someone she&#8217;s like 70 percent hair and she&#8217;s too petty and messy) but i don&#8217;t feel like waiting, derek and ahsha are just meh, and i&#8217;m tired of hearing about how awful oscar is but not actually seeing it, and terrance is a serious fool</p>
<p>i&#8217;m only here for sloane, kyle, and devon carter even though he barely talks anymore</p>
