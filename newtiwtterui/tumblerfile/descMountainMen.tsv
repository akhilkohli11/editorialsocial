Most people enjoy the modern technologies and conveniences of today -- ``smart'' phones, tablets, cable and satellite TV among them -- but there are those who choose to live off the grid in the unspoiled wilderness, where dangers like mudslides, falling trees and bears are all part of life. ``Mountain Men'' profiles some of them. Eustace Conway, who has lived at the western edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina for more than 25 years, teaches interns about the old ways of living with nature. Tom Oar needs an entire year to prepare for the 7-month-long winter on Montana's Yaak River. In Alaska, Marty Meierotto must gather enough wood to survive -- in complete isolation -- winters that can have temperatures drop to 60 degrees below zero. It's not easy, but for these mountaineers, it's life as they know it.
