<p>So Syfy&#8217;s THE WIL WHEATON PROJECT is E&#8217;s THE SOUP, but more geek-focused?</p>
<p>Syfy&#8217;s <strong><em>The Wil Wheaton Project</em></strong> is considerably more mean-spirited than I&#8217;d anticipated or hoped for.</p>
<p>Syfy moved THE WIL WHEATON PROJECT up to 9pm, and HEROES OF COSPLAY back to 10pm?!</p>

<p>Grr.</p>
<p>Have you guys seen The Wil Wheaton Project yet?</p>

<p>He&#8217;s freaking hilarious! Everyone should watch that show.</p>
<p>So i was about to post about felcia day being on The Wil Wheaton Project, when suddenly Castiel and Dean show up out of nowhere and make my day</p>
