<p>*FINALS ARE FINISHED SOOOO, DO WITH ME WHAT YOU WISH*</p>

<p><br/>
  Clarke didn’t know how long she had been locked in the white room. The lights never dimmed and the only indication as to life outside the door was the occasional knock and the sound of a sliding tray. They matched the walls: white and glossy. The food was not much better tasting than the food the 100 had managed to scavenge, but it filled her up just the same. She enjoyed the daily baths she took behind the curtained shower in the corner and she didn’t find it difficult to sleep either, because she sensed no immediate danger. Sleep never came though. Her mind was rallied and scattered. Day and night, whenever they were, Clarke thought of the last moment she saw Finn Collins. She thought of his nod of understanding. Ultimately the nod that had supposedly ended his life. Those images played a part in the nightmares she had whenever she managed to fall asleep, but the most troubling of the images came in the shape of one Bellamy Blake.</p>

<p>  She’d told him to run, he’d seen her and for a moment she thought he would listen to her. Run to her and pull her behind him and into the dropship, but of course, Bellamy being Bellamy meant he would not give up. He would risk everything to protect the hundred, down to his very last breath. He was loyal. Stubborn,  but loyal. Clarke had come to admire that about him in the month that they had been on the ground. Now she just wished he had listened.</p>

<p>  Seeing Tristan beat Bellamy had left an emotional scar on her. He was her partner, the person she turned to if she had a query, the person she trusted… he was her friend.</p>

<p>  As she sat on the pristine couch, she pulled her legs up and wrapped her arms around them.</p>

<p>    Find the others, a voice commanded in her head. Not surprising to her, it was Bellamys voice. </p>

<p>  Clarke got up and walked to the door, peering out of the circle shaped window she saw Monty pacing in his room. She was glad that he was safe. She watched as he walked and dissappeared and then walked the opposite direction and disappeared. She did this every so often to calm herself down, Monty never disappointed. He was always pacing. He stopped when he saw her watching, his shoulders sagging with a sigh and relief flooding his features. His dark eyes suggested he hadn’t slept well, Clarke was sure that she looked worse if not just the same. Her lips stretched up in a smile and he smiled back resting his forehead on the glass of the window. His lips parted and a flood of warm air clouded the transparent material. His hpfinger reached up and traced letters in the condensing air.</p>

<p>    ’U ok?’ it read.</p>

<p>  Clarke smiled again and nodded. She mimicked his actions and traced her own message.</p>

<p>    ’U?’</p>

<p>  Montys face contorted in a grimace and he shrugged his shoulders. Breathing hard on the glass, his fingers moved quickly across the fogged window.</p>

<p>    ’Whts going on?’ He had taken up almost the entire window with his message and it disappeared as quickly as it has appeared leaving his confused face in its wake.</p>

<p>  Clarke shook her head, admitting that she had no clue and Montys shoulders sagged again in defeat.</p>

<p>  She rested her head forward onto the window and sighed.</p>

<p>    I hope they’re okay, she thought.</p>

<p>  Clarke glanced up again in hoped of telling Monty she’d see him later but what she saw wasn’t just the face of her friend but a much closer face, covered from the pointy nose, down to its chin by a face mask. The cold green eyes that stared back into her own made her freeze. Montys face was a mask of horror and curiosity behind the face.</p>

<p>    ”Step back.” A voice echoed from behind her, she whirlled half expecting a masked murderer and half expecting a figure to materialize. There was no one there.</p>

<p>  She turned again , back to the window and kept her eyes on the face as she tookna cautious step back.</p>

<p>  She heard clicking and technological noises before the door slid into the wall in a loud gush, From across the hall, Montys door slid open simultaneously. </p>

<p>    ”Monty,” she said cautiously. She stepped out into the hall and turned to the face, now accompanied by a full body length suit of white, plastic like material. Its stance, and body shape gave way to realization that the person was a man. He beckoned for Monty to come out and for a moment he hesitated, so Clarke lunged forward and encased him in a hug. He took a while to respond but when he did they found themselves in a fit of laughter. It had been so long since any of them had had any human contact and it felt good to share it with a friend.</p>

<p>  They pulled away when they heard the doors swoosh closed, turning to the man in white. Monty stepped in front of Clarke protectively but she could feel him shake as he tried to size the man up. The corner of the mask on his face slid upand suggested he was smiling underneath. </p>

<p>  ”Follow me.” He said in a calm and authoritative voice. He turned on his heel and started walking towards a door at the end of the hall. Clarke stared after him, wheels turning in her head.</p>

<p>    ”Do you think we’d make it if we ran the other way?” Monty asked seriously, voicing her thoughts.</p>

<p>  Contemplating it, Clarke glanced at Monty. They locked eyes for a moment and understanding passed between them. Curiosity had won.</p>

<p>  They started walking slowly towards the man who had paused in front of the door, waiting for them.</p>

<p>    ”Like the outfit, by the way. Less menacing than the usual get up.” Monty said, laughing nervously.   They were halfway there. He was dressed almost identical to Clarke. White top and bottoms and completely barefoot. </p>

<p>  Despite the situation, Clarke felt herself smile. </p>

<p>    ”Thanks,” she said. “I try.” She felt him relax next to her as they stopped behind the man. His hand came up to the wall beside the door and a bright green light traveled its length. With a click the door slid open. The man stepped aside letting Clarke and Monty walk into the room silently.</p>

<p>  Clarkes eyes watered and Montys jaw dropped.</p>

<p>    ”Oh my, God.” Monty choked through a sob.</p>
<p>I was just thinking about this&#8230;in the Pilot, Jasper was speared <em>after</em> he crossed the boundary to Mount Weather&#8230;.maybe the Grounders weren&#8217;t trying to kill Jasper..they were trying to stop them from crossing&#8230;maybe they were protecting everyone, the 100 and the Reapers and themselves included, from the Mountain Men. Maybe if the Mountain Men knew that the 100 were around, they would have come looking for them or something; more like, if the Fab Five [Clarke, Finn, Jasper, Octavia, and Monty] had gotten to Mount Weather, it would have been like poking the sleeping bear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a thought really. Anyone else have any theories?? I&#8217;d love to hear them!!!</p>
<p>no but the mountain men are all modern and whatnot, yeah? what if they saw the ark come down and went up to save jaha? (obvs they&#8217;d get the info from abby/kane)</p>
