<p>IF YOU WATCH MASTER CHEF MESSAGE ME</p>
<p>watching tonights ep of masterchef and ughhh I hate when the judges ask the contestants questions just for the sake of drama.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m talking about when Joe spoke with Ahran during the mystery box challenge and asked her who she thought was a strong competitor. she said willie and joe was all why not courtney? and ahran said she thought the judges might favor her, which led joe to sass back a bit</p>

<p>and I just dont get why that was necessary? at all? considering that willie IS a strong competitor? like that question was so clearly meant to stir up drama</p>
<p>they had basic recipe cards with them for certain challenges? Like the pie one in the latest episode - some of them have never made pie or even a pie crust and yet they&#8217;re just truckin along? Hmmm</p>
