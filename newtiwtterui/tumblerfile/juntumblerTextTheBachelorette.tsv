<p>marquel works for UFC and is teaching Andi to defend herself i love this man</p>
<p>he literally just forced her to put him in a chokehold i think i&#8217;m in love</p>
<p>oh boy</p>
<p>some seriously awkward shiz just went down </p>
<p>andi is crying</p>
<p>this is like when you&#8217;re at someone&#8217;s house and their little brother like bangs his head really hard and starts crying and you&#8217;re like so super awkward like i feel bad but i don&#8217;t know you but you&#8217;re crying? what do i do</p>
<p>even more awkward is this guy that just left (got kicked off? initiated his own breakup kindof) died after he left the show in some kind of extreme sports accident? this is just all kinds of uncomfortable</p>
