<p>276.5 down .4 from yesterday.</p>
<p>What I ate:</p>
<p>Crispy chicken bacon ranch McDonald&#8217;s salad</p>
<p>Turkey goolash (turkey burger, tomatoes, cabbage, broccoli, bell pepper, onion, etc)</p>
<p>4 fudgecicles.</p>
<p>Got my garden for spring started, get a phone&#8230;. yeah, that about sums up yesterday.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve eaten one serving of 0% Fage with blackberries.</p>
<p>For dinner I&#8217;ll probably heat up the leftover goolash.</p>
<p>28 days left to lose 25lbs, I think I can do it as long as I don&#8217;t cheat anymore! last week really set me back.</p>
<p>I try to avoid it (most times). Recently I shared in a bio about myself for the studio I teach at that I&#8217;ve lost over 150 lbs. Since that I&#8217;ve had a lot of &#8220;exactly how much have you lost???&#8221;. &#8220;A lot&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem satisfying and when I tell them &#8220;as of Sunday it&#8217;s 172&#8221; they stare at me in disbelief. </p>

<p>I want people to know, because people who have a lot of weight to lose should know it&#8217;s possible without surgeries or diet pills or giving up food all together. </p>

<p>At the same time, its hard to admit out loud that I was that in denial of my health. It&#8217;s crazy to think that I waited so long to do what I needed to do to get started on a healthy path. It&#8217;s embarrassing and painful to admit that all out loud summed up in a number. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud of who I am now, who I taught to become. I&#8217;m still a work in progress though. If 172 makes someone realize - I can too! Then I guess it&#8217;s a number I&#8217;m going to have to say more often &#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently 164.2 down from 305.4 thanks to weight watchers!</p>
