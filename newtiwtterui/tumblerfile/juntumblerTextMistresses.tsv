<p>I love Lincoln from the 100. I was so excited to see Ricky Whittle in Mistresses, I shouted &#8216;Age appropriate!&#8217;</p>
<p>I feel bad for really wanting Harry and Jos to get together</p>
<p>Justin wasn&#8217;t in the episode. Darn it&#8230;.</p>
<p>The greatest disaster of a character to ever grace our screens is coming back tonight! Karen Kim, I&#8217;ve missed you!</p>
<p>Watching Karen Kim lose her mind is my new favorite thing.</p>
