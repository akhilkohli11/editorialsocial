<p>THE GIRL ON AMERICA&#8217;S GOT TALENT RIGHT NOW GOES TO MY SCHOOL WATCH HER SHE IS AMAZING</p>
<p>Julia goes to my school I&#8217;m SO glad everyone loves her</p>
<p>She was the star of my school&#8217;s production of Annie Jr. in elementary school, and you all should look her up on youtube</p>
<p>(I agree that AGT should be more talent than singing, but she goes to my school and she is amazing)</p>

<p>Ah yes. It&#8217;s not summer unless I aggressively watch America&#8217;s got Talent on demand in my pjs during the afternoon. But then give up once auditions are over because I can&#8217;t be bothered to watch past the 1500 episodes that are the qualifiers before round 2.</p>
<p>Call me a cynic, but some of those back stories on the <em>America&#8217;s Got Talent</em> contestants make me want to vomit up every bit of saccharine that is in my body. This is not adult Make a Wish.</p>
