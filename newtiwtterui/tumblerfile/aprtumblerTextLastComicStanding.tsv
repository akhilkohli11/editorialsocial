<p><strong>Drennon Davis, Hampton Yount, Guy Branum, Deanne Smith</strong>, and more comedians that should be way more known than they are currently are featured in the trailer for the new season of <strong>Last Comic Standing </strong>premiering <strong>May 22nd on NBC</strong>. </p>
<p>Hopefully, they make it to being a finalist. Watch the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWcNwlGC_tw" target="_blank">here</a>. UPDATE: trailer is currently not available from NBC for some reason, but we swear what we said was true</p>
