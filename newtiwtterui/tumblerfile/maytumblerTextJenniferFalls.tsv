<p><strong>Jennifer Falls</strong> is the latest addition to TV Land&#8217;s lineup of original sitcoms. It revolves around Jennifer, a successful career woman, that has to completely rebuild her life after losing her high-powered, high-paying job. So, that means she’s moving back in with mom with her teenage daughter in tow! Not exactly what we would call an ideal living situation…but certainly a funny one!</p>
<p>Filming is well underway and from the looks of <a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferFallsTV" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the cast is having tons of fun backstage!<a href="https://twitter.com/JenniferFallsTV/status/464898305567125505/photo/1" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/f5e5053c4341925e29d003b5705b20c4/tumblr_inline_n5kwnjEVuc1r86tiz.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A little too much fun, perhaps&#8230;</p>
