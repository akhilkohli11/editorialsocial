<p>Did any of you guys see nbc&#8217;s crossbones last night? It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been anticipating Crossbones since last summer and the first episode completely blew me away.</p>

<p>The cadence and rhythms of the script are beautiful. It was very much aural porn. The call and answer pace and the rapid fire witty repartee was awesome.</p>

<p>The main speaking parts were fairly evenly divided.</p>

<p>Thomas Lowe the spy, protagonist<br/>
Blackbeard the Commodore, antagonist<br/>
Selima El Sharad the code breaker<br/>
Kate Balfour the quartermaster</p>

<p>They accomplished in one episode what most series would take a season to establish. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how this progresses.</p>
<p>(My cable was down and life happened, so I&#8217;m just now getting to this episode. &gt;.&lt;&#8221; )</p>
<p>So I felt like I was playing catch-up for quite a bit of this episode. Did they change the air order? Or are they assuming their audience is smart enough to infer events we aren&#8217;t explicitly shown?</p>
<p>Keeping up with the myriad of first ep characters and the subsequently introduced ones required a bit of rewinding (the &#8220;wait, who is that&#8221; reaction), but it&#8217;s fun too. You feel the world being rapidly fleshed out as though you&#8217;re experiencing the whole of rather than a sliver.</p>
<p>The banter kept it&#8217;s pace and lovely cadences. It&#8217;s still makes me terribly happy just to listen to the song of it. But then I realize that while I&#8217;ve listened to it, I haven&#8217;t heard it. I watched this episode twice over scene by scene. Oops. No big deal.</p>
<p>I find it interesting how little time we spend with the &#8216;protagonist&#8217;, Lowe. We see all facets of the story, but not the shape of the gem. The twisty-turny motives and cork-screw thought processes of the main characters are fascinating.</p>
<p>This is a thinking show to be sure.You can&#8217;t stop paying attention for a second.</p>
<p><strike>What game does the Commodore&#8217;s second in command, Selima, play? To frame another pirate captain in an attempt to get Blackbeard to exercise his power? Or to strengthen his follower&#8217;s loyalty by allowing them their choice of justice? Was that even her voice we heard? Has she or someone else been slowly poisoning the Commodore so that he sees the hallucination? Was that how she knew to send Valentine&#8217;s men to the altar? Or did they merely follow and corner him there?Â </strike>Oh, OH. It was a plan. Well that smacked me right in the face. &#8220;Well if I&#8217;d done him myself, I might have come across as disagreeable.&#8221; Jeez. Well played. Although, from his talk with the Lady Companion Leader, she made it sound as though she asked Valentine&#8217;s men to kill the Commodore. But that was <em>not</em> her accent, so?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also of interest that Kate gave Lowe an alibi, particularly of that nature. Oughtn&#8217;t she know that the Commodore will slip that into a conversation with his clock maker? What is her interest in this man about whom she knows so little and for whom she would stake so much? (Oh children, this is going to be such a mess.)</p>
<p>And what about the Commodore, Blackbeard? From all the stories, one would think he a much worse man than what he&#8217;s presented thus far. What caused the change of heart? Or is he playing the long con, interested in resting after decades of nothing but work, work, work all the time. Letting the legend pass and letting the man live. Or is it a long standing vendetta he pursues? If so, who is the target?</p>

<p>Another packed episode; I&#8217;m exhausted. I look forward to this Friday.</p>
