<p>Y&#8217;know how we do little raydor things, what if we did like little flynn things, or little provvie things, or little tao things, etc. I think it&#8217;d be really cool if we made it a thing. So if you want prompts message me or send me prompts if you want to. xD</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care who you send it for either. I wanna stretch my creative muscles!!!</p>

All of them." Awww - such a cute and very Buzz to say something like this. The writers should contact you!!!</span></span></li>
</ol><p><span class="action">It felt like a Buzz thing to say so I kept it. AND THANK YOU!!! I just love these character so much and I want to do them justice. Sometimes I do wonder if the people on Major Crimes come on tumblr and see what we&#8217;re up to. If they do I hope they like what they see!</span></p>
