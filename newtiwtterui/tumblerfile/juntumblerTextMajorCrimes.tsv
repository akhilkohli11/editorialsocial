<p>like i realllly want to watch the adventures of sharon and rusty but i don&#8217;t feel like going through all the procedural stuff can somebody magically conjure up a supercut for me so i can catch up easy</p>
<p>Rusty and Ned Bigby besties? Heck yeah.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m watching tv and a commercial for a beer mixed with lemonade drink and it&#8217;s called Summer Shandy. You might remember that picture I got from Facebook. They kept saying things like &#8220;Enjoy a Summer Shandy&#8230;&#8221; I was dying!!!!</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t have DVR and I want to live in all the glory that is a 19 hr marathon of Major Crimes so I think I am going to actually get myself into the mode of watching the whole entire marathon from 3am my time to whenever the season 3 premiere episode airs. I make no guarantees that I dozes between some episodes&#8230;but I am going to try my hardest to do this. I want to leave my early 20s with no regrets and this sounds like a whole lotta fun.</p>
<p>So I missed the majority of this because I got screwed up on what time the marathon started. But My god I forgot how calculating the murderer was in this one and I didn&#8217;t see it coming at all the first time I watched. I forgot they got the printer in this episode too, I LOVE IT!!! I also forgot how horrible the director is as a father. Somebody should contact other family members.</p>
<p>Also the BOOM promo just played and OMG Mary is adorable in that!!!!</p>
