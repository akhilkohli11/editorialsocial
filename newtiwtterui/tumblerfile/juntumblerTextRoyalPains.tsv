<p>Santino Fontana is on one of my favorite shows omg omg omg</p>
<p>God I just bet Dmitri just spent the entire first half of Season 5 just calling Boris and being like &#8220;Boris. Dude. Boris call Hank. Please call Hank, he&#8217;s a pain in my ass and he doesn&#8217;t grieve well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Royal Pains is like my new favorite thing. Cute, funny, nice main characters (one of them is an Indian WOC!); fun medical plot; nice outfits; Hamptons scenery and setting; USA Network&#8230; HOW did I miss this show?</p>
<p>has it been that long since I haven&#8217;t watched? someone needs to give me a run down of what happened for the last two seasons. lol.Â </p>
<p>royal pains comes back tomorrow</p>
