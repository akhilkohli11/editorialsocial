<p>But that &#8220;Halt and Catch Fire&#8221; pilot was really great. You should head over to the AMC tumblr and watch it. </p>
<p>I am suffering, because I cannot watch preview of Halt and Catch Fire :( Can someone do something with this? Like upload it on any other host? </p>
<p>Episode one was soooo good. Even I don&#8217;t understand so much some electronics language, it still was good. I loved music, details, colours&#8230; And of course characters. Joe is such an asshole but I like him (he&#8217;s interesting guy). Cameron first seemed to be naive but then I liked her too. And I hope that Gordon would be more, just like computers ;) Can&#8217;t wait next episode!</p>
<p>HALT AND CATCH FIRE EPISODE ONE IS AVAILABLE FOR PREVIEW HALLELUJAH THANK YOU AMC</p>
