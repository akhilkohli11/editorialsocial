Wil Wheaton began acting at a young age, but he was a teen when he landed the role that would define his career: playing Wesley Crusher in ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Thanks to that role -- and more recent appearances on ``The Big Bang Theory'' -- the actor and blogger has become somewhat of a cult figure in the sci-fi community. So what's taken him so long to get his own show on Syfy? Regardless of the reason, the time has come. This weekly series gives Wheaton a chance to share his insider view and genre expertise with viewers as he breaks down some of the week's hot topics in areas that include science fiction, pop culture and video games. Thanks to his resume and passion for pop culture, Syfy describes Wheaton as ``the ideal arbiter of what's hot and what's not in the genre Space.''
