<p>***</p>
<p>MURPHY, YOU BLOODY DICK!<br/>So Lincoln stayed around and saved Finn and Clarke. Now, is Monty alive?<br/>Do those Reapers eat humans or something?<br/>Bellamy&#8230; All the way from &#8220;Whatever the hell we want&#8221; indeed. A pretty long one, and I&#8217;m proud.<br/>Well, if Ark can&#8217;t stay in space anymore, then it&#8217;s coming to Earth. Or at least some part of it is.</p>
<p>I JUST WATCHED THE SEASON FINALE OF THE 100 AND I AM NOT OKAY RIGHT NOW. NOPE. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT EPISODE????</p>
<p>Sometimes if I am unsure about something I just ask myself &#8220;What would Clarke Griffin do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone know where I can get logoless copies of the 100 episodes?</p>
<p>wow okay guys cool your testosterone</p>
