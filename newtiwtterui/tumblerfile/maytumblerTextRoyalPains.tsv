<p>Have you ever had this overwhelming feeling of obsession and you feel like you can never exPRESS HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THE THING UGH</p>
<p>Started watching Royal Pains recently.  I’ve noticed whenever Hank is around anyone in his inner circle, he always looks like he’s about 2 seconds away from kissing them.  And I kind of like that?</p>
<p>almost out of school for summer</p>
<p>the vampire diaries is done until next fall </p>
<p>the originals are done for too </p>
<p>so is the blacklist &#8230;</p>
<p>and royal pains</p>
<p>lets not even mention Shameless&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>what the fuck do i watch now&#8230; </strong>any recommendations based on my television preferences?</p>
<p>USA shows are literally chock full of strong female characters of varying age, race, orientation, and background i don&#8217;t understand why people don&#8217;t watch USA more</p>
<p>so we&#8217;re watching Royal Pains and we just started so we&#8217;re in season 2 and my sister is asking if Jillian and Hank are dating because apparently they&#8217;ve cuddled and in this really gruff voice my dad just &#8220;they&#8217;ve done more than that&#8221;</p>
