<p>is anyone watching last comic standing? becuase keenen ivory wayans is a judge and he keeps saying really misogynistic things and no one is talking about it. like he told a woman that her attractiveness was distracting from her act, and that she needed to tone it down if she wanted people to pay attention to her comedy. like wtf?</p>
