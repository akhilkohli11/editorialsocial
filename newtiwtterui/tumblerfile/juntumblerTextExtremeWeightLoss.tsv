<p>Oh good extreme weight loss is on so self hatred is 100% right now</p>
<p>I really fucking hate the show Extreme Weight Loss.  This poor kid on tonight&#8217;s episode treated himself with some chocolate and soda, and immediately Heidi Powell gets on him, and OBVIOUSLY that&#8217;s the reason that he missed his goal by FIVE FUCKING POUNDS.</p>
<p>AND GOD FORBID HIS MOM GETS A GODDAMN BOYFRIEND.  OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL HINDER HER PROGRESS BECAUSE THEY DON&#8217;T FUCKING BELIEVE IN HER.</p>
<p>Chris and Heidi need to learn that, while exercise and eating healthy is important, <strong>it is also important to take time to treat yourself.  It is important that you do things for yourself that makes you happy.</strong></p>
<p>They also need to learn to <em><strong>have some fucking faith in their clients.</strong></em></p>
<p>Watching Extreme Weight Loss and bawling my eyes out. I relate to this show so fucking much. ??????</p>
<p>Just finished bawling my eyes out to that Extreme Weight Loss show. This woman who had three kids and two jobs lost 150 pounds in a year and she ultimately ended at 160 pounds&#8230;.which is my goal. If she can do it, I can do it. I&#8217;m sobbing omg </p>

<p>70 pounds gone</p>

<p>I&#8217;m gonna kick this last 30s ass</p>

<p>Waking up in a few hours to go run at the park. The Phoenix on repeat. The only song that can push me to do what I find impossible.</p>
<p>I forgot that watching Extreme Weight Loss makes me cry every 5 minutes.</p>
