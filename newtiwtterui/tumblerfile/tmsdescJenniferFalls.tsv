Jennifer Doyle had it all. The high-powered executive seemed to be at the top of the world, then she began her descent of the corporate -- and personal -- ladder, eventually hitting bottom. Now she and teenage daughter Gretchen must move in with her mother. Jennifer takes a job at a bar owned by her meek brother and his passive/aggressive wife. There she encounters her former best friend, Dina, who holds a grudge against Jennifer. Nothing is going well in her life. But at the bottom, there's only one direction to go!
