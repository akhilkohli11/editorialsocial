<p><span class="userContent" data-ft='{"tn":"K"}'>Beauty and the Beast is my favorite fairytale, my favorite Disney movie, my favorite movie of all time. I may only have a small collection of Beauty and the Beast merch but I&#8217;m always looking for more. I even had to go to the Grand Opening of New Fantasyland because they have a whole section dedicated to Beauty and the Beast. The dress I got for my sister&#8217;s wedding was<span class="text_exposed_show"> made to look like Belle&#8217;s Little Town dress so I could use it for my first Disneybound. <br/> I have been wanting a live-action Beauty and the Beast movie from Disney since forever. And with how much I love Maleficent, I&#8217;m gunna die. (I have read and collected so many variations of the Beauty and the Beast story, with that details and storyline variations wouldn&#8217;t really be a problem.) It will be so so so amazing for Beauty and the Beast to Finally have some damn attention!!!<br/> If we look at how they&#8217;ve treated their more recent movies, esp. Maleficent, I can only imagine that Hottopic will have a fashion line, there will be all sorts of shirts, journals, mugs and dolls - oh the dolls! I Am So Excited. I wasn&#8217;t even a thought when Disney&#8217;s Beauty and the Beast came out in 1991, and now I get to go through the whole experience of announcement to production to release, etc. I can get all the LE Merch (and just amazing merch) when it actually comes out!! (I won&#8217;t have to search ebay and pay way too much -squees-)<br/> And this means, new costumes!!! I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll still have the iconic gold ballgown but hopefully it&#8217;ll be closer to the new redesign than the YELLOW Dress in the animated film. I cannot wait to cosplay and dress inspired by.<br/><br/> My only stipulation: he actually be a Beast (of some sort) and she have brown hair.</span></span></p>
<p>i&#8217;m gonna be 1950s!Belle and literally nobody is gonna stop me</p>
<p>Belle is my favorite disney princess because there is a whole musical number where the entire town basically says &#8220;yeah she&#8217;s hot, but she fucking weird&#8221; and Belle&#8217;s just like &#8220;hell fucking yeah I&#8217;m hot and weird, peace out. kindness bitches&#8221; and that&#8217;s what I aspire to be like when I grow up</p>

<p>Zboneak BatB!AU version of &#8216;Something There&#8217; The essence of the song&#8217;s pretty much the same, though the language and feeling is shifted to fit Hater and Sylvia better. Also I included a bonding conversation from the movie.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Sylvia:<br/>There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; sweet<br/>And almost&#8230;cute<br/>But he was mean and he was rude &#8216;nd a big brute!<br/>But now he&#8217;s&#8230;nice? and so unsure<br/>I”m not sure how I didn&#8217;t see it there before&#8230;</p>
<p>Hater:<br/>She glanced my way<br/>I thought I saw-<br/>And when we touched she didn&#8217;t freak out at my claw<br/>No, that&#8217;s STUPID! I&#8217;ll just ignore&#8230;<br/>But then she&#8217;s never looked at me like that before</p>
<p>Sylvia:<br/>Weird, and kinda unnerving<br/>Who&#8217;d have ever thought that this could be?<br/>But somehow, he feels deserving<br/>Think there&#8217;s somethin&#8217; there I like-no, that&#8217;s crazy!</p>
<p><br/>Hater:<br/>I never knew these books could do that<br/>Sylvia:<br/>Do what?<br/>Hater:<br/>Take me away from this place, make<br/>me forget for a little while<br/>Sylvia:<br/>Forget?<br/>Hater:<br/>Who I&#8230;What I am&#8230;<br/>Sylvia:<br/>Guess we have something in common.<br/>Hater:<br/>What&#8217;s that?<br/>Sylvia:<br/>In the town where I come from, the people think I&#8217;m a freak.<br/>Hater:<br/>You?<br/>Sylvia:<br/>Yeah. So I know how it feels to be&#8230;different.<br/>And I know&#8230;how lonely that can be.</p>
