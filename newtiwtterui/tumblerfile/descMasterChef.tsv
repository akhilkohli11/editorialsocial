Award-winning chef Gordon Ramsay, restaurateur Joe Bastianich and chef Graham Elliot return for a fourth season of the culinary competition. A coast-to-coast search reveals the nation's best home cooks, who receive a chance to come to Los Angeles to present their signature dishes to the judges. The cooks that impress Gordon, Joe and Graham receive a white apron and move onto the next round. Throughout the season, the contestants are faced with a series of tough challenges and elimination rounds that determine which cook has the skill, passion and drive to win the title and a life-changing prize.
