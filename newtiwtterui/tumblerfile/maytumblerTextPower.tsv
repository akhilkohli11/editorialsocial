<p>I hate people who run, who won&#8217;t even face themselves in the mirror. Who make up all this bullshit pseudo psycho babble to make themselves okay with how terrible they are.</p>
<p>I lost so much respect for you (what little remained), and I&#8217;m only aligning myself with people I know have my best interests at heart. And if that just ends up being myself, I will thrive as I&#8217;ve done on my own for so long anyway.</p>
<p>Fuck people that can&#8217;t face themselves, that can&#8217;t appreciate how fucked up they are, that can&#8217;t take the minute or two to be like &#8216;oh this isn&#8217;t how the world works, maybe I should change my shitty self.&#8217;</p>
<p>This is what I get for getting involved with a self-centered person. I shouldn&#8217;t have expected anything less.</p>
<p>"no one man should have all that power/the clock&#8217;s tickin, i just count the hours"</p>

<p>man i just can&#8217;t even comprehend the level of fame one direction are on</p>
<p>i&#8217;m over here like &#8220;WOOOOO 22 LIKES ON MY ART!&#8221;</p>
<p>and harry&#8217;s over there getting 71 THOUSAND likes on a picture of a stranger in 5 minutes</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t ever actually remember following Beyonce on twitter or Instagram. I just know that I do.</p>
<p>One thing that really tells me that we live in a patriarchal society is that my boyfriend is fine calling me a goddess without question- but I am afraid of calling him a god. Not because he is not amazing or strong or anything else, but because the connotation with god feels much heavier than goddess.</p>
<p>Being male and female counter parts to the exact same power level, this should not be so- God and Goddess are gendered notions of the same entity. However the word &#8220;god&#8221; has been associated with power, and &#8220;goddess&#8221; with beauty.</p>
<p>And if that is not a symptom of what our culture values in men vs. women, or what it sees in each sex, I do not know what is.<br/><br/>In fact, let me give you what my computer gives as the synonyms for each:<br/>"god</p>
<p class="p2">noun</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>1&#160;</strong>(<strong>God</strong>) <em>a gift from God</em>: <span class="s1">the Lord</span><span class="s2">, </span>the Almighty, the Creator, the Maker, the Godhead; Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh; (God) the Father, (God) the Son, the Holy Ghost/Spirit, the Holy Trinity; the Great Spirit, Gitchi Manitou; <span class="s3">humorous </span>the Man Upstairs.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>2&#160;</strong><em>sacrifices to appease the gods</em>: <span class="s1">deity</span><span class="s2">, </span>goddess, divine being, celestial being, divinity, immortal, avatar.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>3&#160;</strong><em>wooden gods</em>: <span class="s1">idol</span><span class="s2">, </span>graven image, icon, totem, talisman, fetish, juju.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p2">vs.</p>

<p class="p2">oh wait, guess what I learned while writing this post, it doesn&#8217;t have goddess, it redirects me to godless. psych.</p>
