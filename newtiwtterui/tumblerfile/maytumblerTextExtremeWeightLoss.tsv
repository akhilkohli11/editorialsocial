<p>I’ve always enjoyed this show, more than the Biggest Loser (especially after last season’s extreme loss by one contestant)!<br/>
I’m hoping to find some inspiration. Half marathon training starts next week!! Eek!! <br/>
Can I do this again??! It’s going to be a crazy summer. I’m learning new stuff at work which I’m super excited about &amp; I’ll be training 4 days a week! I can do this. .<br/>
I Can Do This! <br/>
I CAN DO THIS!!! ?</p>
<p>I have crossed an invisible line in weight loss where my boobs have disappeared (currently at -91 lbs). I need to invest an even smaller bra in order to make the best of what I&#8217;ve got. </p>

<p>I am now a card carrying member of the IBTC.</p>
<p>SPOILER (of extreme weight loss):
Okay wow the guy on Extreme Makeover made me extremely angry<br/>
1. If you quit only because you find out your baseball contract was bullshit, then you wouldnt be able to keep the weight off anyway in the long run so it’s a good thing you quit when you did <br/>
2. You quit. You decided you didn’t want to do this. That was YOUR choice. So you can’t come back and tell Chris and Heidi that you change your mind and you want to come back. AND YOU ARE SO LUCKY THAT THEY ALMOST TOOK YOU BACK. OH MY GOD. I would have slammed the door in your face and told you never to come back bUT NO THEY WERE SO WILLING TO TAKE YOU BACK. They were literally willing to take you into their home and work with you! And what do you tell them? “I just want to be left alone!” oH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME I’M SO ANGRY</p>
<p>So recently I was at a friend&#8217;s house and she was flipping channels.  Up popped Extreme Weight Loss, a show where a trainer and his wife help people lose hundreds of pounds in a year.  Sounds great right? WRONG.  I was shocked when the trainer and his wife expressed &#8220;disappointment&#8221; in a women who ONLY lost 75 pounds in 90 days.  Apparently, she hadn&#8217;t hit the arbitrary number of 85 pounds.  So here is a woman with significant body image issues and a binge eating disorder who works 2 jobs and has 3 kids.  She also struggles with the fear of disappointing her devoutly Christian parents.  And this trainer felt it was appropriate to tell her she failed after losing 75 pounds in 3 months?  Of course, this was all after he placed her on a scale in public so she could &#8220;face her fears&#8221;.  I wasn&#8217;t aware the public shaming was a prerequisite for weight loss.  This show is sending an absurd message that losing enormous amounts of weight in a short time is possible, healthy, and necessary for everyone.  I believe in body positivity, meaning that everyone&#8217;s body should be celebrated.  I also believe in health, wellbeing, and preventative medicine.  If this woman didn&#8217;t feel comfortable in her body and desired (of her own accord) to change it or was experiencing significant health issues due to her weight, I support that as well.  That being said, her decision to change her body should not be a public spectacle that attempts to convince people they are lazy or &#8220;not pushing hard enough&#8221; if they don&#8217;t work out 6 hours a day. As an ex-collegiate athlete, I can tell you that working out 6 hours a day isn&#8217;t necessary or required for you to be happy and healthy! Shows like this do more harm than good!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited that Extreme Weight Loss is back on. The transformations are incredible. Chris and Heidi Powell are so personable too and you can tell they truly care about the individuals they help.</p>

<p>Being curious, I googled Chris Powell&#8217;s exercise program and came across a website that has an entire exercise regimen designed by him. If anyone is looking to lose weight,tone up, and be healthy, this is for you. It is broken down into 4 parts and 3 months at a time. I wanted to pass on this information to anyone who may want to try it.</p>
