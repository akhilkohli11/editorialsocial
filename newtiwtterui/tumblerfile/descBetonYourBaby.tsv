Melissa Peterman acts as host on this game show that sets out to establish how well family members really know their babies. Each week, five families with children between the ages of 2 and 3 and a half participate in self-contained challenges that have the children playing and unknowingly completing tasks on a giant playground, while their families try to predict what will happen. At the end, the families return to compete in the college round for the chance to win $50,000 toward their children's college education.
