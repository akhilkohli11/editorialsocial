<p><br/>Cable Box Description:  A member of the team is killed, prompting Cross to intervene (&#8230;etc, about making it personal, going too far, etc)</p>
<p><br/>Most likely, <!-- more -->this means nothing good for Officer Wendy Sung.</p>
<p><br/>The only character they might otherwise get rid of, is Detective Brian Lucas.   (well, or the pathologist&#8230;but she&#8217;s Angie&#8217;s friend - why would Cross go off the reservation for her?)</p>
<p>After yet another school shooting people are asking themselves &#8220;but <em>why?&#8221; </em></p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be honest, motive isn&#8217;t hard to find in a school setting. Just enter almost any American public school and watch as teachers who don&#8217;t care and students care too much or don&#8217;t care at all destroy each other.</p>
<p>Public schooling here is basically just 12 years of bullying, harsh judgment and criticism from every angle that in the end results in students being taught that they are not smart enough, thin enough, attractive enough, strong enough, dedicated enough, talented enough, athletic enough, <em><strong>good enough</strong>. </em>For anything, not even life.</p>
<p><em>If someone can&#8217;t see the value in their own life, how can we expect them to see the value in anyone else&#8217;s?</em></p>
<p>Baby you are my motivation for everything &amp; don&#8217;t you forget that</p>
