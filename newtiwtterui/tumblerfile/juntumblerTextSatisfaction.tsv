<p>Here is question number 3 of 26:</p>
<p><strong>3. How do we determine satisfaction?</strong></p>
<p>My Answer: Satisfaction occurs when we reach a goal. That goal could be anything from passing a test or eating food. But no matter how satisfied we are, we will always want more. That is human nature. Try to focus on and appreciate what you have, and you will be a happier person.</p>
<p>Is USA really so hard up that they put this much hype on a show about a wealthy white couple being dissatisfied with their marriage?</p>

<p>Really?</p>
