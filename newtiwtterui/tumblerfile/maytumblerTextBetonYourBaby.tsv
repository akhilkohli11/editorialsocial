<h2>What is “Sing Your Face Off”?</h2>
<p>It’s a competition show featuring celebrities who get dressed up and made into a legendary musical icon. Once transformed, they will be trained on how to perform as that icon and then perform for the audience.</p>
<h2>Celebrity Contestants</h2>
<p>Each of the five celebrities will find themselves transformed into a man or woman, young or older person and the audience gets to see the transformation happen. The celebrities are: Sebastian Bach/legendary rock star from the band Skid Row, Landry Fields/NBA’s Toronto Raptors, Jon Lovitz/comedian, actor, singer, China Anne McClain/Disney Channel’s “A.N.T. Farm,” and Lisa Rinna/”Days of Our Lives”.</p>
<h2>Here’s a preview clip for both shows</h2>

<h2>More About Sing Your Face Off!</h2>
<p>From the hours in the makeup chair to the days spent with choreographers and vocal coaches, each show will feature the complete transformation – not just physical – the celebrities will embody everything about the assigned icon – their walk, their talk, and their distinguishing mannerisms leading up to the live performance in front of the studio audience. Viewers will get the chance to see each of the celebrities portray multiple musical performers during the series — such as Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, Pavarotti, Pitbull, Britney Spears, and Tina Turner to name a few.</p>

<h2>Our Interview with <a href="http://www.johnbarrowman.com/biography.shtml" target="_blank">John Barrowman</a></h2>
<div id="attachment_11841" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11841" src="http://www.redcarpetreporttv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/132555_4001_pre-200x300.jpg" alt="JOHN BARROWMAN" width="200" height="300"/><p class="wp-caption-text">John Barrowman, Host of SING YOUR FACE OFF – ABC announced the premiere of new summer series “Sing Your Face Off,” on Saturday, May 31 from 9:00-11:00 p.m. “Sing Your Face Off” is a talent variety competition featuring celebrities who are transformed and trained to perform as a legendary musical icon.

<p>Okay, we admit to being a “fangirl” of John’s body of work and just in case you didn’t know he <span style="color:#000000;">acts, sings, dances, writes, presents/hosts and judges. He’s more than a triple threat, he’s the perfect person to bring the audience into the world of transformation with this new show.</span></p>
<p>We asked John what drew him to this project to host “Sing Your Face Off?” John started out by reminding us about being a kid and dressing up… <em>“when we [my nieces and nephews] were younger, we’d dress up and do shows for our family. That’s what we did together as a family… having a good time, enjoying ourselves.”</em></p>
<p>With the contestants in “Sing Your Face Off” already being a celebrity in their own rights, we asked John what was he most surprised to see about how they faced and dealt with their persona transformation and performance? <em>“First, I was impressed at how seriously they took it and how much fun and outrageous they looked. They didn’t hold back, they went gung-ho.” Some examples John shared were with “Landry Fields becoming a woman and teasing him, you’ll never be able to go back to the </em><i>locker room now” to “Lisa Rinna becoming a man and China Anne McClain becoming a much older woman.”</i></p>
<h3>John tells us ‘<em>the audience laughs at them, we laugh at them and they laugh at themselves.’</em></h3>
<p>We asked John about who he thinks the audience will be most amazed by with these transformations and he told us <em>“Jon Lovitz will come out and blow you away with one he does, with one of the songs he sings…”</em></p>
<h3>What Was John’s Favorite Part?</h3>
<div id="attachment_11850" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-11850 size-medium" src="http://www.redcarpetreporttv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/132442_0223_pre-300x199.jpg" alt="CHINA ANNE MCCLAIN, JOHN BARROWMAN, SEBASTIAN BACH, LANDRY FIELDS, JON LOVITZ, LISA RINNA" width="300" height="199"/><p class="wp-caption-text">CHINA ANNE MCCLAIN, JOHN BARROWMAN, SEBASTIAN BACH, LANDRY FIELDS, JON LOVITZ, LISA RINNA on SING YOUR FACE OFF – “101 &amp; 102? — “Sing Your Face Off,” a talent variety competition featuring celebrities who are transformed and trained to perform as legendary musical icons, will premiere on SATURDAY, MAY 31 (9:00-11:00 p.m., ET/PT). ABC/Kelsey McNeal</p></div>
<p>With any new TV show or movie we like to know, what was your favorite part? It’s our “family” tradition to talk about after watching it. So we asked John what his favorite part of watching each celebrity take on their new persona. <em>“The fun of it, </em>[the show]<em> and getting to be John Barrowman. The thing I do when presenting is be myself. I get to react to it honestly and I am laughing hysterically in some cases </em>[during taping Sing Your Face Off]<em> to a point where I can’t even talk.”</em> Not just John, but the celebrity and guest judges are also consumed by the transformation and everyone finds themselves laughing uncontrollably. That’s a good sign, isn’t it…</p>
<p>John also likes to tell everyone that he works with on shows like this to pretend they are going to all jump off a cliff and fly. The object being that if they fly and the parachute opens, everything is working and its great, if the parachute doesn’t open, well then it’s time to fix things.</p>
<h3>Who Was John’s Favorite Celebrity Contestant?</h3>
<p>Ha ha. We thought we could sneak in a question that he might just answer, but he reminded us that he was not new to the interview process… as he laughed. He did tell us that <em>“there is ONE performer who is consistently brilliant every time.”</em> Hmm. Wonder who he is referring to? Guess we’ll have to watch and try to figure it out?</p>
<h3>Last Two Questions</h3>
<p>Okay, so we had to ask, which role to-date has been his favorite in his career… and guess what it is? Yeah, wrong. John told us <em>“I don’t <strong>answer</strong> favorite questions, but I love playing diverse characters </em>[I have played].<em>“</em></p>
<p>Finally, we had to know, what was the most outrageous thing that a fan has done to meet him. He told us that he was <em>‘standing at a urinal, when the guy next to him looked over and recognized him and turned and said “Captain Jack” only to urinate on his shoe… John told the fan to turn his head, not body.’</em> Uh-oh.</p>
