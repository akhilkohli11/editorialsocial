<p>reminder that i have the kaguragakupo url</p>
<p>if im doing this i gotta listen to the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHnfX1RmZX8" target="_blank">best and most inspiring song to me according to my 6 year old self</a></strong></p>
<p>There is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Reactor_overview" target="_blank">a reactor</a> being designed which will use a large number of gigantic niobium-tin superconductors to squeeze hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) plasma into a thin circle and heat it up <strong>hotter than the surface of the sun</strong> so that it fuses together, creating a miniature circle-shaped star. If it works, the main problem that they will have is that <strong>it will be so <em>bright</em> that it will knock the atoms out of the metal</strong> that surrounds it.</p>
<p>If they figure out how to overcome that problem, it and reactors like it will be able to <strong>power our entire civilization</strong> on tiny amounts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium" target="_blank">seawater</a>Â and have no chance of criticality (explosion) or meltdown like a fission reactor does. The worst that could happen is that the cryostat breaks and the magnets melt, releasing a cloud of <strong>completely harmless hydrogen and helium</strong>.</p>
<p>Oh, and it would produce enough energy that we could <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/antistat.html" target="_blank">generate significant amounts of antimatter</a> for, say, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/antimatter_spaceship.html" target="_blank">starship propulsion</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the awesomest thing then get the fuck out.</p>
<p>If you ever feel like children are powerless in society just remember I&#8217;m the only one in my house who knows the wifi password. Not my dad who set it up, or my mom who&#8217;s addicted to the internet. Me. Only me.</p>
<p>w/ Omari Hardwick is good. I have a feeling this going to be one of my favorite shows, but I don&#8217;t see it getting a lot of ratings.</p>
