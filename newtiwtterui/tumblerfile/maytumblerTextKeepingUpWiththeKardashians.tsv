<p>I really wanna know why is Rob Kardashian&#8217;s name doesn&#8217;t start with a K? They could&#8217;ve called him Kurtis, Kane, Kirk, Kade, Kale/Kael like why was it Rob but all the girls have K&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Im bored and watching Keeping Up With the Kardashians because nothing else is on. I feel like my IQ is dropping every second and why they hell are they famous?</p>
<p>Kanye and Scott are more kardashian than rob is tbh</p>
<p>You&#8217;re hella excited for Kim &amp; Kanye&#8217;s wedding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only ever watched one episode of keeping up with the kardashians but in the one I watched Bruce Jenner ended up taking a baby chimpanzee to a playground</p>
