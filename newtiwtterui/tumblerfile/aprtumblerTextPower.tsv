<p class="font_8">I was first gonna write this post about how ruff everyone handles me despite how delicate I am. In the space of one week I got cussed out by my trainer, flopped by two &#8216;friends&#8217;, dissed by the guy im talking to, hated by my coworker, and basically told by another one that I cant do nothing right ANDDD all of this while having to repair a broken tire myself &amp; fight the cold with no sleep.</p>
<p class="font_8"><span>After all this i was just like PLEASEEE lord give me a sign, I have no idea why ppl have to be so rough with me. Do I look like I dont have a heart? I am a nice caring person but still I just get beaten, abused, and stepped on. So while im here wollowing in my sorrow I decided I might as well go to the gym&#8212;  mainly because I already paid my trainer and he&#8217;s just gonna have to suck up seeing me.</span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span>While i&#8217;m there I literally went through all my reps like a machine, like, i stopped twice to breathe in the whole hr session, and my gym mates were like waat, wat got into you good job bla bla bla. Then i wondered, was I being lazy? was I really just not pushing myself? I mean it didnt hurt more going through a million excercises without stopping to check my phone every rep, and I got out of the gym way faster.</span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span>So as i&#8217;m driving home reflecting on that I wonder, maybe those ppl that are handling me so are doing so for a reason, like, you know, God wants me to make a decision. Obviously the guy a get cut, maybe he was saying open your eyes this is wrong for you, obv the frenz a get cut, maybe he was saying the same. As for my coworker I just don&#8217;t know because I will never do anything right in that regard, but obv I need to jus keep trying right?</span></p>
<p class="font_8"><span>Newyz, I guess my point is, whenver you think someone is tearing you down or making your life miserable it may mean you need to change something, either your interaction with them, or your interaction with life. Either way ima take this new found &#8216;strength&#8217; and try and see if I can mend my wounded heart. Cuz damnnn a bitch jus wants some love :&#8217;(</span></p>
